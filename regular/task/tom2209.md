## Create a ClusterRoleBinding

The __Role Bindings__ view in the __Permissions__ section of the Kyma Console UI allows you to create bindings between groups and roles.

### Create a ClusterRoleBinding and bind the recruitment group to the kyma-edit ClusterRole

Follow these steps to bind the recruitment group to the kyma-edit ClusterRole:

1. Access the Console UI of your Kyma cluster. 
2. Click __test-namespace__.
3. Click __Permissions__ on the left navigation menu.
4. Click the __+ Create Binding__ button.
5. Enter `recruitment` for the User Group.
6. Select `ClusterRole` for the Kind.
7. Select `kyma-edit` for the Role.

## Namespaces

Namespaces is a concept used by Kubernetes to divide a cluster into different logical units. In addition, Namespaces allow the developer to outsource code that is needed multiple times into modules. This makes the code as a whole clearer and better structured. For example, when creating an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster, there are three Namespaces available: __default__ (pods and deployments), __kube-system__ (existence of core resources), __kube-public__ (used for resources to be visible across the whole cluster). 

>**NOTE:** Read the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) and the [Microsoft Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#namespaces) to learn more about Namespaces and Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
