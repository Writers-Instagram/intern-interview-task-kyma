## Create a ClusterRoleBinding

The __Role Bindings__ view in the __Permissions__ section of the Kyma Console UI allows you to create bindings between groups and roles.

### Create a ClusterRoleBinding and bind the `recruitment` group to the `kyma-edit` ClusterRole

Follow these steps to bind the `recruitment` group to the `kyma-edit` ClusterRole.

1. Access the Console UI of your Kyma cluster. 
2. Click the __default__ Namespace.
3. On the left pane, go to __Permissions__.
4. Click the __+ Create Binding__ button.
5. Enter `recruitment` for the User Group.
6. Select `ClusterRole` for the Kind.
7. Select `kyma-edit` for the Role.
8. Click the __Save__ button.

## Namespaces

Namespaces is a concept used by Kubernetes to divide a cluster into different logical units. In addition, Namespaces allow the developer to outsource code that is needed multiple times into modules. This makes the code as a whole clearer and better structured. For example, Namespaces are useful vor Azure kubernetes Services (AKS). 


When you create an AKS cluster, the following namespaces are available:
default: Pods and deployments are created in this namespace by default if no other namespace is specified. In smaller environments you can deploy applications directly in the default namespace without creating additional logical partitions. When you interact with the Kubernetes API, such as kubectl get pods, the default namespace is used if no other namespace is specified.
kube-system: This namespace contains basic resources such as network features like DNS and proxy or the Kubernetes dashboard. You usually do not provide your own applications in this namespace.
kube-public: This namespace is usually not used. However, it can be used for resources that you want to be visible across the entire cluster, and it can be viewed by all users.
For more information, see Kubernetes Namespaces.
