# Overview

The purpose of this task is to check the basic skills of a technical writer and give you a glimpse of what technical writers in Kyma do and what tools they use. You get a chance to play with the software you are going to write about and learn more about the underlying technology. Fear not, we know that first steps are not easy and we don't expect you to [save the princess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B-d3VHTdh0) right away.

The task at hand is designed to allow us to verify the approach you take to solve a problem and lets us learn more about the techniques you use.

# Task

## Step 1

Fork this repository and create a new file in the `task` folder. Name the file after your GitHub user name. The file must have a  `.md` extension. For example, `jacktorrance.md`.
Write all of the required content in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and save it in the file you created.

## Step 2

Access the Kyma cluster prepared for the recruitment process. Use the provided credentials.

>**NOTE:** The password and email are encoded with base64. Decode the credentials before use.

## Step 3

Explore the Kyma cluster. Create a ClusterRoleBinding and bind the **recruitment** group to the **edit** role. Create a step-by-step instruction for users that want to achieve this exact goal. Introduce the instruction with an `H2` heading.

When writing the instructions, follow the [Kyma guidelines for creating content](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/guidelines/content-guidelines), the [Microsoft Manual of Style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), and reference the writing style seen on [kyma-project.io](https://kyma-project.io/docs/) to create a piece that could become a part of product documentation.

>**TIP:** When writing, use the **Preview changes** option in the GitHub UI or an external Markdown editor, such as [jbt.github.io](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) to check if your Markdown displays correctly.

## Step 4

Kyma and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) rely heavily on Namespaces. Conduct research and create a short definition of what a Namespace is. In your definition include an example that illustrates how users can use Namespaces in their implementations. Introduce the definition with an `H2` heading.

## Step 5

Create a pull request to this repository.

# Expected outcome

The expected outcome is a [pull request](https://github.com/Writers-Instagram/intern-interview-task/pulls) with a single file that contains all of the required content.
